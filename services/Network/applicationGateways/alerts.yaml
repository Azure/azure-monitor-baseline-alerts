- name: Application Gateway Total Time
  description: Time that it takes for a request to be processed and its response to
    be sent. This is the interval from the time when Application Gateway receives
    the first byte of an HTTP request to the time when the response send operation
    finishes. It's important to note that this usually includes the Application Gateway
    processing time, time that the request and response packets are traveling over
    the network and the time the backend server took to respond.

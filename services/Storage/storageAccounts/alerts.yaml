#ALZ published alerts/thresholds [ALZ alerts are more platform based...]
- name: Availability
  description:
    The percentage of availability for the storage service or the specified
    API operation. Availability is calculated by taking the TotalBillableRequests
    value and dividing it by the number of applicable requests, including those that
    produced unexpected errors. All unexpected errors result in reduced availability
    for the storage service or the specified API operation.

    accounts, it's the sum of capacity used by blob, table, file, and queue. For premium

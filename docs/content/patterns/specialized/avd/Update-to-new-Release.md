# How to update to a new release

Moving from the version 2.x to version 3.x is as simple as re-deploying the solution. The previous alerts and automation accounth with associated runbooks will remain in place. It's recomended to deploy the new 3.x solution and enable the alerts in phases as previous for testing and later remove or delete the 2.x alerts you no longer need. The description for the alerts will include the version number for ease of finding and removing those alerts.

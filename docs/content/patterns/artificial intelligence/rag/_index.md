## Overview

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern is an industry-standard approach to building applications that use large language models to reason over specific or proprietary data that is not already known to the large language model.

This page provides the alert settings for AI RAG pattern setup. It contains relevant metrics and threshold recommendations for key services involved in a RAG pattern architecture. For a reference architecture design of RAG based on Cloud Adoption Framework, please see [Azure OpenAI chat baseline architecture in an Azure landing zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone)
<!--Below is a basic architecture of RAG implementation

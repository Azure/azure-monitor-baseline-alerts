## FastTrack for Azure - Monitoring Starter Packs (MonStar Packs)

## Objectives

- Minimize the initial ramp up required for customers, in multiple aspects of the Azure technologies to deploy basic monitoring.

- Minimize the need for the Customer to determine the minimal monitoring items for a certain type of workload

- Provide best practices out of the box on items that need monitoring for different workloads. The Monitoring Packs work closely wit the Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts [AMBA](http://aka.ms/amba) and the Azure Monitor teams to provide a comprehensive and aligned monitoring solution.

- Create a framework for collaboration that will make it easy to add new monitored technologies.

For a details about the solution, please refer to [Azure Monitoring Packs](https://github.com/Azure/AzureMonitorStarterPacks)

## Pre-requisites and recommendations

- Azure Subscription - an Azure subscription to deploy the components
- A Management group structure with at least one management group. Most of the elements like policies and permissions need to be deployed at a management group level.

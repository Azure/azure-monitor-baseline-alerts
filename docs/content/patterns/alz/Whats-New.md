With this enhancement, it is now possible to remove alerts for resources which have been deletedf (orphaned alerts).

### New features

- **AMBA Portal Accelerator**: We are thrilled to introduce the Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts Accelerator, now available in preview! The new deployment method is accessible directly through the Azure Portal UI, providing a user-friendly interface that guides you through the setup process. This means you can deploy alerts faster and with greater confidence. It simplifies the process of setting up baseline alerts, ensuring that you are promptly notified of critical metrics and log anomalies that could indicate potential issues with your Azure deployments. To begin using the AMBA Portal Accelerator click the Deploy to Azure button below. Please refer to the detailed deployment instructions for further guidance. **[Deploy via the Azure Portal (Preview)](../deploy/Deploy-via-Azure-Portal-UI)
- **Modular approach to Initiatives**: Recognizing the limitations of a monolithic approach, we have deprecated the former Landing Zone Initiative. The initiative was becoming too large and impractical. Instead, We have adopted a modular approach by splitting the initiative into the following distinct components. For more details please visit: [Policy Initiatives](../Policy-Initiatives)
  - Key Management
  - Load Balancing
  - Network Changes
  - Recovery Services
  - Storage
  - VM
  - Web
- **Threshold Override:** Some resources need thresholds different from the baseline set in the Policy Definition. The Alert Threshold Override feature lets both Greenfield and Brownfield customers adjust these thresholds for specific resources, before or after deployment. By using a tag with a specific name and value, you can override the default alert threshold. This custom threshold applies only to the tagged resources, replacing the global parameter value. This feature is available only for metrics and log alerts. Learn more: [Alert Threshold Override](../Available_features/Threshold-Override)
- **Custom tags and values to disable monitoring**: The updated feature lets you specify both a tag name and a list of values. For example, if you have an "Environment" tag with values like "Production," "Development," or "Sandbox," you can deploy alerts only for "Production" resources by disabling monitoring for those tagged as "Development" and "Sandbox."
- Added new alert rule for Azure Key Vault Managed HSM. This has been included in both the Identity and Key Mananagement initiatives.
- Added new Daily Cap threshold alert on a Log Analytics workspace. This alert has been added to the Management initiative.
- Added new Application Insight Throttling alert. Included in the Web initiative.
- Added new ActivityLog Alert for deleting Application Insight. Added to the Web initiative.
- Added the ability to change the Application Gateway dynamic alert sensitivity
- **Deprecated** the Landing Zone Initiative

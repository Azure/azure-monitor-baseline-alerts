## Overview

This document details the AMBA-ALZ pattern Azure policy initiatives used for deploying the AMBA-ALZ baselines. For references on individual alerts/policies, refer to [Alert Details](../..//Getting-started//Alerts-Details).

## Connectivity initiative - Part #1

This initiative is intended for relevant policy assignment to networking components in ALZ. Using the guidance provided in [Introduction to deploying the AMBA-ALZ Pattern](../../HowTo/deploy/Introduction-to-deploying-the-ALZ-Pattern), this will assign policies to the alz-platform-connectivity management group structure in the ALZ reference architecture. For details on the initiative policies and their default enablement state, refer to the table below.

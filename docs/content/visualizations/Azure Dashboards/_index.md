## Overview
[Azure dashboards](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards) are useful in providing a "single pane of glass" of your Azure infrastructure and services.  Dashboards are a focused and organized view of your cloud resources in the Azure portal. Use dashboards as a workspace where you can monitor resources and quickly launch tasks for day-to-day operations.
